<h1>THE BEST BL ACCORDING TO VJ</h1>
<h2>My top three BLs all the time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>I told sunset about you</h3>
<p>This series shows the struggle of a person of accepting himself before the acceptance of the others.</p>
<h3>I promise you the moon</h3>
<p>This is the 2nd part of the previous one. In this part it shows the struggle of his love and career life. <br /> <br />**The above two are highly recommended series by me if it is your first time exploring BL world.</p>
<h3>2gether The series | Untamed</h3>
<p>These two are my all time favourite. I can never get enough of them. These are like tharapy to my stressed life.</p>
